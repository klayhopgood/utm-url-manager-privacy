    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> [Insert Date]</p>

    <p>Thank you for using the UTM-URL Manager Chrome Extension. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle data, including the information that our extension accesses and the limitations on its usage.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>Our extension is designed with privacy as a core principle. We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any user data. Specifically, the following types of information are not collected:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personally Identifiable Information:</strong> We do not collect your name, address, email address, or any other personally identifiable information.</li>
        <li><strong>Health Information:</strong> No health data is collected or processed.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial and Payment Information:</strong> We do not collect any financial data, including payment methods or transaction details.</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication Information:</strong> We do not collect passwords, credentials, or any other authentication information.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Communications:</strong> Our extension does not access, store, or transmit your personal emails, texts, or chat messages.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Information:</strong> We do not collect or process any location data, such as your IP address or GPS coordinates.</li>
        <li><strong>Web History:</strong> We do not track or access your browsing history.</li>
        <li><strong>User Activity:</strong> We do not monitor your clicks, mouse position, keystrokes, or other activities.</li>
        <li><strong>Website Content:</strong> Our extension does not store or transmit any content from the websites you visit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Data Processing Practices</h2>
    <p>Our extension’s sole purpose is to help users add UTM parameters (source, medium, and campaign) to URLs in their emails on Gmail. This data processing is done entirely within the user’s browser, with no data transmitted to external servers or third parties. The extension accesses email content within Gmail only to locate URLs for adding UTM parameters as requested by the user.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Permissions</h2>
    <p>The following permissions are requested solely to enable the core functionality of the extension:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>activeTab:</strong> Allows the extension to access the URL of the current tab to extract and modify URLs within Gmail.</li>
        <li><strong>host_permissions (*://mail.google.com/*):</strong> Allows the extension to interact specifically with Gmail, so it can locate and update URLs within emails.</li>
        <li><strong>scripting:</strong> Used to inject scripts into Gmail for URL identification and modification within the user’s emails.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All of these permissions are essential for the extension’s intended function, and none of them are used for data collection or tracking purposes.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since no data is collected, stored, or transmitted, there is no risk of data leakage or unauthorized access. All operations are performed locally on the user’s machine within their browser, ensuring privacy and security.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated date at the top. Your continued use of the extension after any changes signifies your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us at [Your Contact Information].</p>
